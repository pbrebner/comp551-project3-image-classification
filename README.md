# Classification of Image Data

writeup.pdf: The main report of the project

Using the CIFAR-10 dataset with the default test and train partitions

## Multilayer Perceptron
Implement the model from scratch including backpropogation and the gradient descent algorithm (SGD)

Run MLP_1.ipynb to load the data and run the model

## Convoluational Neural Network
Convolutional Neural Network built with PyTorch and torchvision. The initial CNN, inspired by LeNet-5, had two convolutional layers (with max pooling) followed by 3 fully connect layers

Run Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb to load the data and run the model

## Results
Compared the test and train performance of the above two models as a function of training epochs. Hyper-parameters such as the number of layersm number of units, and acivation functions were adjusted to test performance
